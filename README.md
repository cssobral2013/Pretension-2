# Pretension 2
Is developed from Inter (https://github.com/rsms/inter), Inter-Derp (https://github.com/Derpitron/inter-derp/), and Pretendard (https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard).

Main changes include:
- Flattened alternates for legibility (tailed l, and spurred G);
- Flattened open-contour digits (3, 4, 6, and 9);
- Reversed r to the one found prior to v3.0;
- Changed 1 to the form used in Inter Display;
- Applied horizontal terminals to a/e/g/s-related glyphs,
  as well as tilde, in Regular and Thin masters (and their Italics).
