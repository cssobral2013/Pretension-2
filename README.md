# Pretension-Two
Is developed from Inter (https://github.com/rsms/inter) & Inter-Derp (https://github.com/Derpitron/inter-derp/).

Main changes include:
- Flattened alternates for legibility (serifed I, tailed l, and spurred G);
- Flattened open-contour digits (3, 4, 6, and 9);
- Reversed r and 1 to the one found prior to v3.0;
- Applied horizontal terminals to a/e/g/s-related glyphs,
  as well as tilde, in Regular and Thin masters (and their Italics).
